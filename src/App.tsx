        Terms and Conditions
        These terms and conditions (the “Agreement”) establish the comprehensive legal framework governing your access to and usage of the websitepolicies.com website (the “Website”) and its related products and services (collectively, the “Services”). This Agreement serves as a binding legal contract between you (referred to as “User,” “you,” or “your”) and Dynamic Terms Inc. (“Dynamic Terms Inc.,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). In the event you are accessing and using the Website or Services on behalf of a corporate entity, business organization, or any other legal entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you possess the necessary authority to bind such entity to the terms outlined in this Agreement. In such cases, references to “User,” “you,” or “your” shall refer to the entity you represent. If you lack the requisite authority or do not agree with the terms outlined in this Agreement, you are expressly prohibited from accepting this Agreement and from accessing or using the Website and Services. By continuing to use and access the Website and Services, you confirm that you have thoroughly reviewed, understood, and agreed to abide by the terms of this Agreement and privacy policy. It is important to recognize that this Agreement constitutes a legally binding contract between you and Dynamic Terms Inc., even though it is presented in an electronic format and does not require a physical signature.

        Accounts and membership
        If you choose to create an account on the Website, you accept full responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials, including your username and password. You also agree that you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, including but not limited to any transactions, content submissions, or other actions undertaken using your account. Dynamic Terms Inc. reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to review new accounts before granting full access to the Website and Services. If you provide false or misleading contact information during the account registration process, we may terminate your account immediately and, in some cases, without prior notice. In the event of any unauthorized access to your account or any security breach, you must notify us promptly. Failure to do so may result in further unauthorized activity for which we will not be held liable. Dynamic Terms Inc. will not be responsible for any damages or losses incurred as a result of your failure to secure your account information. Additionally, we retain the right to suspend, disable, or permanently delete your account if we determine that your conduct or content violates any provision of this Agreement or is harmful to our reputation. If your account is terminated for these reasons, you are expressly prohibited from re-registering for the Services, and we may block your email address and IP address to prevent further attempts to access the Website and Services.

        Billing and payments
        You are required to pay all fees and charges associated with your account in accordance with the pricing and billing terms in effect at the time the payment is due. All pricing is listed in United States Dollars (USD) unless otherwise specified. Our Services are offered on a recurring subscription basis, which means that your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the billing cycle selected by you unless you cancel your subscription prior to the renewal date. By subscribing, you authorize us to charge the payment method on file at the recurring intervals selected by you. We offer a money-back guarantee for new purchases in accordance with our refund policy. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may request a refund within the specified time frame outlined in the refund policy. After the refund window has passed, no refunds will be provided, and the subscription will continue until canceled. You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings on the Website. If you choose to cancel, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be charged for the subsequent renewal. If you do not cancel your subscription before the renewal date, it will automatically renew, and the applicable fees will be charged to your payment method. We may provide full or partial refunds if you choose to cancel your renewal after you were charged at our discretion.In the event that we determine a purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we reserve the right to request additional information to verify the transaction, such as a copy of a valid government-issued photo ID or a recent bank statement associated with the payment method used. This process is designed to ensure the security and integrity of all transactions conducted through our Website and to protect both our users and Dynamic Terms Inc. from fraudulent activity.

        Accuracy of information
        While we strive to ensure that all information on the Website is accurate and up to date, the information available on the Website may contain inaccuracies, omissions, or typographical errors. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time, without prior notice, even after an order has been submitted. This may include canceling orders if the information pertaining to the purchase was incorrect at the time of submission. Additionally, we are not obligated to update or amend any outdated information on the Website, including but not limited to pricing information, except as required by law. It is important to note that the presence of an update or refresh date on the Website should not be interpreted as an indication that all information has been modified or is current.
